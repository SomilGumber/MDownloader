# MDownloader

## Introduction
> MDownloader, as Mass Downloader is a massive web page downloader where you enter URL of the website, and rest will be downloaded and saved in your folder without doing anything. Just enter the URL and it'll automatically download it for you.<br>
Made by <a href="https://github.com/SomilGumber">Somil Gumber</a> and Manal Shaikh.

## Requirements
> pip install requests

## Code Samples

For your convenience, we have set an example for CIA's factbook. The URLs and examples are mentioned in the code and urls.txt. Once you run the script, you will know the rest.

## Installation

Open the download.py and replace the part of the URL in the "grab" function. This will ensure that all the filenames are set automatically. The text file will be read upon running the script and saved filename will be set as whatever it is between those 2 variables in grab function.
